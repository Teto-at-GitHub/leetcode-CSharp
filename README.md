# Leetcode solutions for [NeetCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/neetcode) in C#

This is my personal fork of https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode.
I am adding C# solutions to the [blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75) collection of problems.

## Update

In the meantime, C# solutions were added to the main repo, but I prefer working with my sln/proj setup as it allows for quick testing in the IDE.

### Naming convention

For each exercise in <https://neetcode.io/> we add :
- a folder in `csharp/<exercise_group>/main`
- a .cs file in `csharp/<exercise_group>/testCases`

The name of the folder/files is `N<i>-L<j>-<name>`, where :
- `<i>` is the position of the exercise in https://neetcode.io/
- `<j>` is the number of the same exercise in LeetCode
- `<name>` is the name of the problem on neetCode within its group
